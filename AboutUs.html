					<h1>About Us</h1>
				</div>
				<p>This website was solely created, designed and written by me over a period of about 6 months. I myself is a student who is attempting IGCSE MJ 2020(which was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19) and thought that some sort of online platform with tools to help students in their practice could be great.During the start of this website, I barely had any idea about web developments except a few bits of html and css I learned during the ICT subject. Obviously, through several hours of reading free ebooks and informations from internet in cohesion with countless trial and errors, I have learned a lot about web development as well as programming in general. I dream to be a programmer one day and wish to help others with my skills so now, I am still learning more about programming and also thinking about ways that I could further help you guys with your studies. The only words I want to say from the bottom of my heart is that just that thought of being able to help you out with your studies and seeing you guys getting A*s in exams is enough to cheer me up and keep going! &#128578;</p>
